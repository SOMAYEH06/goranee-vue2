This is a personal project inspired by https://goranee.ir/. This site displays a list of famous Kurdish singers with the chords of their songs. In this project I have used their api to displaya list of singers. To access this api, you need to send a valid token that I have defined in the axios file in the ( _axios.interceptors.request.use ) section. This site will probably have changes in the future.
